# Tasks

Work on intro here.

Tell them to always use the plugin they are given as much as possible, and also to make sure they copy the comment accompanying each copy as well (it will tell us in our logs where they are at progress wise).

## Task 1
[maybe put tags here like this for our usage? like...][copy source from multiple windows][inside editor copy]

In /keymaps/clipboard-history.cson you will find keymaps for our package, however, we only have keymaps for 'platform-darwin', we need to make sure our windows and linux friends can use our plugin too!

Head on over to /source/source1 to grab your first copy, the windows keymaps. Copy this (remember to grab the comment too) and then paste it back in our clipboard-history.cson underneath the 'platform-darwin' block.

As well head over to /source/source2 to grab the second copy, our linux maps, and repeat the exercise, copying and pasting the block underneath the windows block this time.

## Task 2
