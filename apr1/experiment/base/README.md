# Base experiment files

This directory contains all of the base code which was provided as is to our testers. In each case a participant was given this directory in an Atom instance which was already running one of our packages we developed (or none for the control group).

Participants were given [these tasks](https://github.com/cleebp/csc-510-group-g/blob/master/apr1/experiment/tasks.md) and asked to complete them as quickly and efficiently as possible.
