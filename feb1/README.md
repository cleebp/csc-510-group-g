##Abstract

Computer programmers rely on a myriad of tools and production environments in order to produce quality software in a productive manner. Of these tools, the simple copy and paste command is used frequently by programmers to save time. In this paper we examine the behavioral motivations as to why programmers make use of the copy and paste command, as well as when and how they actually use it. Furthermore, we investigate the problems that can arise from using this command in the form of code clones and duplications, and their implications. Finally we propose a project wherein we will be building a fully featured Eclipse IDE plug-in, Clipit, which will provide Java programmers with a visual clipboard manager that enhances their productivity when copying and pasting, and alleviates the problems associated with using this common command.

##Development Repository 

Since we collaborated on this report through the wonderful site Sharelatex, we made use of their Github syncing utilities. Unfortunately, they only let you sync to a brand new repository, and we had already created this main one. So, in addition to this main repository we also have a separate repo where we worked on the report throughout January, it can be found here: https://github.com/cleebp/group-g-feb1-report
