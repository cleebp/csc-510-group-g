# my-panel1 package

This section adds a panel feature to the base version. User can view copied items on a static right panel.
- Copy items by Ctrl+C
- Paste items by Ctrl+V
 

When user copies an item from atom workspace, it immediately shows on the panel. For items outside of atom workspace, they will be displayed on the panel after pasting on atom workspace.
