* Got everything compiling now, had a bad indent in the main lib file

## 0.0.6 - Debugging
* Working on getting indexNext to work
* Keybinding override isn't going through, gonna try giving it a new binding

## 0.0.8 - Basic stable version
* Things work as intended
* Need to implement copy resetting the paste index
